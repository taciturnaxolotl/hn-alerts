> ### Your personal Hacker News success tracker üìà üîî üöÄ  
> A slack bot that tracks when you make it to the front page of Hacker News; developed with üíñ @ [Hack Club](https://github.com/hackclub)

## üî• What it does

HN Alerts watches Hacker News for you and anyone else that chooses to trust your instructions to run `/hn-alerts-link`, notifying you through Slack when:

- Your posts appear on the front page (top 30)
- Your posts climb the rankings
- Your posts reach the coveted #1 position üèÜ
- Any significant changes to your post's performance

The dashboard provides:
- Real-time position tracking with historical graphs
- Performance metrics (peak position, time on front page, comment activity)
- Leaderboard of all tracked stories
- Detailed analytics for each post's journey
- An excellent caching mechanism (this took me so very long to implement)

## üöß Dev

You can launch the bot locally with bun

```bash
bun install
bun dev
```

you will also need to launch an ngrok tunnel and update your dev slack manifest to point to the ngrok tunnel

```bash
bun ngrok
```

you also need to create a `.env` file with the following keys

```bash
SLACK_BOT_TOKEN="xoxb-xxxxx-xxxxx-xxxxx-xxxxx"
SLACK_SIGNING_SECRET="xxxxx"
SLACK_CHANNEL="C08KX2YNN87"
NODE_ENV="dev"
SENTRY_DSN="https://xxxxxx@xxxxxx.ingest.us.sentry.io/xxxx"
```

Don't forget to initialize your database:

```bash
bun db:push
```
